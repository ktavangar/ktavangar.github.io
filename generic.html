								<h2>Snails in the Milky Way Disk Phase Space</h2>
								<p>I am doing my first year project at Columbia with Prof. Kathryn Johnston
									focusing on the phase-space spirals in the Milky Way disk. These spirals 
									were discovered by 
									<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018Natur.561..360A/abstract">
										Antoja et al. (2018)</a>. Since then, researchers have discovered just how
									prevalent these spirals are and various possibilities have been proposed
									for their cause, including perturbations from Sagitarrius or bar buckling.
									We are using a new method to analyze these spirals with more detail than ever
									before, yielding a deeper understanding of dynamics in the disk. This project 
									is currently in the early stages and I'm excited about where its heading.
								</p>
								<h2>The GD-1 Stream</h2>
								<p>I am currently working on an analysis in Gaia's DR3 of the GD-1 stream with Dr. Adrian 
									Price-Whelan. GD-1 is a great laboratory for stream-perturber simulations 
									because it is relatively close to us, it is a very long stream (120 degrees!) 
									and it is very bright. It also has some complex features like a spur (a 
									bifurcation in the stream track) and some gaps. I am creating a purer and 
									more complete catalog of GD-1 members and then modeling the perturber which 
									caused the spur and these gaps.</p>
								<h2>The Phoenix Stream</h2>
								<p>During my undergrad at the University of Chicago, I was advised by Prof. 
									Alex Drlica-Wagner. My <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925..118T/abstract">
									first completed project</a> was an analysis of the Phoenix stellar stream 
									using Dark Energy Survey (DES) data by fitting a non-parametric spline model 
									to the density, track, and width of the stream. We found that Phoenix has 
									structure on smaller scales than other similarly modeled streams. If a dark 
									matter subhalo caused those perturbations, the required low mass of the subhalo 
									could help constrain the nature of dark matter!</p>
								<h2>The Palomar 13 Stream</h2>
									<p>In a project led by Dr. Nora Shipp, we 
										<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..244S/abstract">
											discovered tidal tails around the globular cluster Palomar 13</a>
										When confirmed, this will be one of the only streams for which we have a 
										known progenitor, which can greatly help constrain the orbit. Getting the 
										right orbit is crucial for increasing our understanding of the Milky Way 
										potential and the way structure moves within and interacts with the dark matter halo.
									</p>
								<h2>Strong Lensing</h2>
								<p>Chicago Optically-Selected Lenses - Located at the Margins of Public SURVEYSCOOL-LAMPS
									(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018Natur.561..360A/abstract">
										COOL-LAMPS</a>) is an awesome collaboration started by Prof. Mike Gladders and Dr.
									Gourav Khullar at the University of Chicago. It consists of the ~10 students each
									year that take the "Field Course in Astrophysics" course with Mike, who work together
									on a strong lensing project, where Mike and Gourav are world-leading experts. I am 
									proud to have been a part of the first class, where we discovered the brightest z~5 
									galaxy in the universe! Since then, COOL-LAMPS has published a couple more papers and 
									the exciting thing is that the collaboration grows every year!
								</p>
								<h2>Globular Cluster Tails in DELVE</h2>
								<p>The DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) Survey is a survey of the entire southern sky
									not covered by DES, in an effort to achieve uniform coverage of half the sky. I am 
									working with Dr. Ani Chiti looking for envelopes and tails around any globular cluster
									in the DELVE footprint. This should give us a better understanding of how globular clusters
									form streams and how prevalent this process is.
								</p>
								<h2>High Proper Motion Stars in DES</h2>
								<p>I have recently started collaborating with Dr. Gary Berstein and his students
									to work on finding high proper motion objects in the Dark Energy Survey. This
									is a longer term effort that will prove even more important when applied to 
									the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) since that will allow us obtain accurate 
									proper motions for stars deeper than Gaia can see.
